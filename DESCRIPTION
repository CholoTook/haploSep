Title: Haplotype Separation with Finite Alphabet Lloyds algorithm
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Merle Behr, Housen Li and Marta Pelizzola
Maintainer: Merle Behr <behr@berkeley.edu>
Description: Implementation of an iterative Lloyds type algorithm to separate multiple haplotypes from allele frequency data.
             The number of haplotypes is estimated via singular value thresholding. 
             Then, the haplotype frequency matrix is initialized via a pre-clustering of the allele frequencies and an absolute value ordering of the centers.
             Haplotype structure and frequency matrix are updated iteratively until convergence.
